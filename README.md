The "Snake Game" is a classic arcade game implemented in C++, where the player controls a snake to collect food, growing in size with each piece of food eaten. The game initializes by setting up a grid where the snake and the food are placed, with the snake starting at a specific location and growing as it eats the food. The player controls the snake's movement using the 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' keys to move up, down, left, and right, respectively. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows longer, and new food is placed at a random location on the grid. The score is incremented with each piece of food eaten, and the game continues until the snake runs into itself or the walls, resulting in a game over.

The game mechanics include user input handling, snake movement, food consumption, and collision detection. The game continuously updates the snake's position based on the player's input, checks for collisions with the walls or the snake's own body, and updates the game state accordingly. When the snake's head reaches the food, the snake grows, and the score is updated. The program also redraws the game board on the screen after each move, displaying the snake, food, and current score. This implementation showcases fundamental programming concepts such as arrays for storing the snake's body segments, random number generation for placing food, and real-time input handling to control the game dynamics.
